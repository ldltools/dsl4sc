    (** appliable (r, pre, post) (w1, w2) examines whether r is applicable
	to a transition from w1 to w2.

	- it returns false, when there is absolutely no chance, that is,
	  when either (pre(r) âˆ© w1) or (post(r) âˆ© w2) turns out to be empty.

	- otherwise, it returns true, since there is a chance.
	  in this case, it also returns some "certainty" value computed as follows.

	[certainty]
	it's a 4-bit value (b0, b1, b2, b3)
	- b1 = (w1 -> pre(r) always holds)
	- b3 = (post(r) -> w2 always holds)
	and returns a 4-bit value of (1, b1, 1, b3) as certainty.
	
	when b1 = b2 = true (1), r is applicable unconditionally.

	Given r = (id, e, c, a), this function returns 0, 1, or 2.
	when it returns 2, it is guaranteed that no runtime checking of c or a
	is needed, since it is statically guaranteed by the following rule,
	which is almost identical with the consequence rule of the Hoare logic.
